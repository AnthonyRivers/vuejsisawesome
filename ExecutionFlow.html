<!-- In the flow of execution of a Vuejs app the order matters.
     The markup defining the entry point for Vuejs must show up
     first. Since the lines of code on the page are process from
     top to bottom sequentially the html must come first otherwise
     if the Vue instance is executed first the root elemment will
     not be define causing an error in the console.
    
     Importing Vuejs framework should come before the script code that
     creates the Vue instance. Otherwise an error will be thrown because
     Vue will not be visible to instantiate.

     The script block that instantiates Vue should come after importing
     the Vuejs framework and after defining the markup that declares the 
     root element Vuejs uses to create a virtual copy of the DOM which will
     be the Vuejs app.

<div id="app">
 
</div>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>

    new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
            
        }

    });
